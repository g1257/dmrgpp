BUGS:

observer: fails if lattice has less than 6 sites.

observer: backwards move give wrong results for fermionic ops.

CLEANUPS:

WFT needs to be disabled if lattice has less than 6 sites.

eliminate Basis::electrons(...) and use FermionSign instead

observer must be able to tell if main run was done with reals or complex

place save(...) functions next to "load" ctors.

string name for basis objects

DensityMatrixSu2 needs optimization

cannot go backwards from infinite loop when WFT is in use
(see WaveFunctionTransfFactory.h line 137)

basis.eq(...) could be uninitialized due to quantumNumbersOld_
being uninitialized. Also true for other private data of BasisImplementation, need to fix

IoSimple needs to be completely replaced by IoNg (issue 5 on github)

Add guard code for singletons.
 
Random number selection needed
