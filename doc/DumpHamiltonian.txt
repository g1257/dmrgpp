See input8800.ain

Note that
SolverOptions=debugmatrix

this enables computing the CRS
at every step

then set
DumpHamiltonian="predicate";

where predicate is explained
at the beginning of file
PsimagLite/src/PredicateAwesome.h
and in this case it can use two
variables
s for sites
l for loopIndex

The filename will be
$root followed by _dump.txt
For example, running
dmrg -f input8800.ain
will create
runForinput8800_dump.txt
