QUESTIONS ABOUT DMRG++ DOCUMENTATION:

IMPORTANT: You need thesis.bib to compile references for this manual.
Instructions are as follows:

cd dmrgpp/
cd ../
git clone https://code.ornl.gov/gonzalo_3/thesis.git
cd dmrgpp/doc
ln -s ../../thesis/thesis.bib
make


Where's manual.tex now?
When one runs make under dmrgpp/src it should be created automatically.
If not, one needs to run make in this directory, that is, in dmrgpp/doc.

What does one needs in order to generate manual.tex?
PsimagDoc, which is included in PsimagLite.

What is PsimagDoc?
See PsimagDoc/README in the PsimagLite distribution.
